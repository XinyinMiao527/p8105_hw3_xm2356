The instacart dataset is a large dataframe containing 1384617
observations and 15 variables. Each observation represents a single item
within a customer’s order. Key variables include:

order_id: A unique identifier for each order. product_id: A unique
identifier for each product. product_name: The name of the product.
aisle_id and aisle: The aisle number and name where the product is
located. department_id and department: The department number and name.
order_dow: The day of the week the order was placed (0 = Sunday).
order_hour_of_day: The hour of the day the order was placed (0-23).

For example, the first few rows show different items like “Bulgarian
Yogurt” and “Organic Whole String Cheese” belonging to different orders.
