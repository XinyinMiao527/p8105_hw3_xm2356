# Problem 1

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")
```

The instacart dataset is a large dataframe containing 1384617
observations and 15 variables. Each observation represents a single item
within a customer’s order. Key variables include:

order_id: A unique identifier for each order. product_id: A unique
identifier for each product. product_name: The name of the product.
aisle_id and aisle: The aisle number and name where the product is
located. department: The department name. order_dow: The day of the week
the order was placed. order_hour_of_day: The hour of the day the order
was placed.

``` r
instacart |> 
  summarize(
    total_obs = n(),
    unique_users = n_distinct(user_id),
    unique_orders = n_distinct(order_id),
    unique_aisles = n_distinct(aisle)
  )
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 4
    ##   total_obs unique_users unique_orders unique_aisles
    ##       <int>        <int>         <int>         <int>
    ## 1   1384617       131209        131209           134

Take the contents of order ID 1 as an example. This customer ordered 8
items, including ‘Bulgarian Yogurt’, which is from the ‘yogurt’ aisle
and ‘dairy eggs’ department. Within these 8 items, ‘Bulgarian

by this user in the past. And the order was placed on Friday at 10
a.m.There are 9 days since the last order.

## How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items ordered from?

``` r
unique_aisles = instacart |> 
  summarize(unique_aisles = n_distinct(aisle))

aisle_counts = instacart |> 
  count(aisle, sort = TRUE)

unique_aisles
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 1
    ##   unique_aisles
    ##           <int>
    ## 1           134

``` r
head(aisle_counts)
```
